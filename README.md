# azure_databrick_class
A tool class that I wrote for working with notebook in backend
  1. Most people will run databrick via data factory, but it is also possible to run / schedule a run via databrick resful API
  2.Somehow MS api doesn't recursively list a directory as Blob Storage does, so I just add that functinaity.
